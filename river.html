        <h1 id="p2-heading">A Typical Day on the River</h1>
        
        <p id="p2-paragraph"> Whether you’re going on your first river trip or your tenth, some of the most common questions are what do we do, how long are we on the water and what is camp like? Our answer is, our trips are never exactly the same because of slight differences like the river, mileage to make, how long the trip is and group preferences. Our crew’s specialty is catering to each group to make their vacation exactly what the group is looking for in the trip. </p>

            <p>What you will Experience is one of the best vacations you’ve ever had. You will Escape the daily grind of life and learn the meaning of “River Time.” Throughout your trip, you will Discover what it is like to be in an “outdoor museum,” exploring hidden wonders and gems of the Colorado Plateau. Last but not least, you will be able to Relax while enjoying a beautiful sunrise or watching the stars before falling asleep. </p>
            
        <h2>Sample Day on the River</h2>
        <p><strong>7:00 a.m.</strong>  Wake up to the smell of fresh coffee and a delicious breakfast cooking. As you enjoy sipping the beverage of your choice, watch the sun light up the canyon walls. During this time, you can enjoy mingling with other guests or just find a quiet spot to enjoy your morning while your guides prepare a delicious breakfast. Breakfasts may include stacks of hot pancakes, French toast or breakfast burritos served with fresh fruit, and tasty bacon. See More Food Options.</p>
        <p><strong>9:00 a.m. </strong> After breakfast we will begin to pack up our camp for the day. As you pack up your personal bag and camp, your guides will pack up the rest of camp. As the guides load the boats, you can take time to relax, stretch or just enjoy the morning. Once everything is ready to go you may hear a safety briefing or other instructions for the day.</p>
        <p><strong>10:00 a.m. </strong> We begin our day on the river floating, watching for wildlife and listening for birds. River rafting offers quality time and many experiences. There is adventure time, quiet time, interaction and reflection time and lots of time to play. Our trips are in some of the world’s finest wild areas. Your boat may be one of several options Sheri Griffith Expeditions provides on trips determined by the river, the length of the trip or your personal choice. Travel down river in your choice of paddleboats, oarboats, and inflatable kayaks.</p>
        <p><strong>12:00 noon</strong>  Lunch is served around mid-day along the banks of the river. Lunches are prepared fresh, on the spot and may include deli sandwiches, chicken Cesar wraps or a pasta salad. While lunch is being prepared, there may be time to hike, swim or just enjoy a cold soda.</p>
        <p><strong>2:00 pm.</strong>  We are back on the water enjoying more spectacular scenery, interrupted now and then by a swim to cool down or a fun rapid. We always try and take an afternoon hike.</p>
        <p><strong>4:00 p.m.</strong>  In the late afternoon we will pull into our next camp, our home for the night. After a brief orientation to camp, we will unload all the camping gear from our boats. On the first night, we will have a tent demonstration to teach first timers how to set up your tent.</p>
        <p><strong>6:00 p.m.</strong>  Appetizers are set up in a central location along with water, lemonade, Gatorade and cold drinks in a cooler. During this time of the day you will have time to sit down and enjoy our river library, take a stroll or join in a game of Horseshoes or Extreme Bocce!</p>
        <p><strong>8:00 p.m.</strong>  After a delicious dinner, we will talk about how to be prepared for the next day. The rest of the night is spent reliving the day’s activities, telling stories and on the last night of the trip, we have a special “dress up” celebration for our trip! And at the end of the day, you go to bed under a canopy of stars! Ready for the next day&#8217;s adventure.</p>
